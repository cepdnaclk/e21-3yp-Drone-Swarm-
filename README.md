Drone swarms have emerged as an important research area in fields such as wireless communication, coordination, and collision avoidance. While many swarm algorithms are proposed and evaluated using simulation environments, real-world validation remains challenging due to unreliable wireless communication, sensor noise, and hardware variability.

This project presents an affordable and programmable indoor drone swarm testbed designed to support experimental swarm research under realistic conditions. The system enables researchers to deploy multiple small drones in a fixed indoor arena, upload swarm logic, and observe real wireless interactions between drones.

This work is developed as part of the PERA Swarm initiative, which aims to advance practical, accessible, and reusable platforms for swarm robotics and multi-agent system research.

By combining UWB-based localization, real drone-to-drone communication, and structured analytics such as packet loss and near-collision detection, the testbed aims to bridge the gap between simulation-based studies and real-world swarm experimentation.
